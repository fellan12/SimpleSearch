With my heart upon my sleeve
I head down low
I still feel broken

Down upon my knees
With my head down low
I still feel broken 

Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm lost and I need you more than
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down

With my heart upon my sleeve
I head down low
I still feel broken

Down upon my knees
With my head down low
I still feel broken 

Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm lost and I need you more than
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down

Down, down, down
