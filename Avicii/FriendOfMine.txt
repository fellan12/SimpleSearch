Hey
Do you remember we said, "Hello"?
And you asked me about my Levi's T-shirt
Said, "You are a friend of mine"
My, oh my
You must have saved me about a thousand times
I wouldn't be the one I am today
If you hadn't been a friend of mine

I ain't misbehaving
I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'll give it all to you
Made me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I've been
If you've haven't been a friend of mine

Hey (hey, hey, hey, hey)
I haven't seen you around since high school (high school)
How you doin', do you still remember me?
Are you still a friend of mine?
(Guess you're still a friend of mine)
(Guess you're still a friend of mine)
Now I see (I see)
Why I get nervous when you look at me
It's like your eye is trying to tell me something
That you're more than just a friend of mine
(That you're more than just a friend of mine, oh my)

I ain't misbehaving
I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'll give it all to you
Made me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I've been
If you've haven't been a friend of mine
