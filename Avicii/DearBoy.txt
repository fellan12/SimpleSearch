So bold and fine
I’ve known you for some time.
Whole life changed while
Bones like yours and mine

Go dance in the woods
And down we go, down, down
Oh, boy, you’re mine
Do you remember old times?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it’s so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow in the blue
It's our time for everything and I call you

Sweet love of mine
Destruction ain't a crime
For those who find
Love is a game like you and I

Go dance in the waters
Of all the tears we have cried
Oh, boy, we're fine
Do you remember our time?

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh dear boy, it’s so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do

Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
You’re a wild boy, I am a wild girl too
Oh, dear boy, it's so shallow in the blue
It's our time for everything and I call you
